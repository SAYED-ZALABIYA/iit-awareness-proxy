# IIT-Awareness Proxy

This repo explores whether statistical integration inside neural networks (Total Correlation) correlates with causal Φ from Integrated Information Theory.

## Structure
- **iit_integration_proxy_merged.py** — small PyTorch MLP with layer-wise Total Correlation visualization.
- **iit_binary_causal_demo.py** — true binary causal network with explicit TPM, computes Φ via PyPhi.
- **results_enhanced.csv / epoch_data.json** — sample outputs.

## Goal
To compare statistical integration (TC) with causal Φ on toy systems and study whether representation-level structure reflects causal integration.

## Environment
Python ≥3.9
